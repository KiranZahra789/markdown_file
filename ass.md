# Python Program: Favourite Numbers Exploration

This Python program takes user input for their name and three favorite numbers, performs a few computations, and returns results based on properties of these numbers, such as whether they are even or odd, their squares, the sum of the numbers, and checks if the sum is a prime number.

## Steps in the Code:

### 1. **Taking User Input:**

- The program prompts the user to enter their name and stores it in the variable `user_name`.
- It then enters a loop where it asks the user to input their three favorite numbers, which are stored as integers in the list `num_list`.

```python
user_name = str(input("Enter your name :"))
for i in range(1, 4):
    num = int(input(f"Enter your {i} favourite number:"))
    num_list.append(num)
```
````

### 2. **Greeting the User:**

- After collecting the user's favorite numbers, the program greets the user and explains that it will explore their favorite numbers.

```python
print(f"\nHello , {user_name} ! Let's explore your favourite numbers:")
```

### 3. **Determining Even or Odd:**

- For each number in `num_list`, the program checks if it is even or odd using the modulus (`%`) operator.
- It prints whether the number is even or odd.

```python
for item in num_list:
    if item % 2 == 0:
        print(f"the number {item} is even")
    else:
        print(f"the number {item} is odd")
```

### 4. **Calculating and Printing the Square of Each Number:**

- For each number in the list, the program calculates its square and prints it.

```python
for item in num_list:
    print(f"the number {item} and its square: ({item}, {item**2})")
```

### 5. **Summing the Numbers:**

- The program calculates the sum of all the numbers in `num_list` using Python's built-in `sum()` function and stores it in the variable `sum_of_num`.
- It then prints the sum of the favorite numbers.

```python
sum_of_num = sum(num_list)
print(f"Amazing! the sum of your favourite numbers is {sum_of_num}")
```

### 6. **Checking if the Sum is a Prime Number:**

- The program checks if the sum of the numbers is a prime number.
- A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- The code uses a simple loop to check divisibility by any number from 2 to the sum of the numbers.

```python
is_prime = True
if sum_of_num <= 1:
    is_prime = False
for x in range(2, sum_of_num):
    if sum_of_num % x == 0:
        is_prime = False
```

- Based on the result of this prime-checking logic, the program prints whether the sum is a prime number.

```python
if is_prime:
    print(f"Great job! the number {sum_of_num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"Great job! the number {sum_of_num} is not a prime number")
```

## Possible Improvements:

- The indentation of the prime-checking code inside the loop seems incorrect, causing multiple printouts for each favorite number instead of once after the loop finishes.
- The prime-checking logic uses `sum_of_num % 2 == 0`, which should check for all divisors instead of just checking for 2. To fix it, we can change the divisor in the loop to `sum_of_num % x == 0`.

### Final Corrected Code:

```python
num_list = []
user_name = str(input("Enter your name :"))
for i in range(1, 4):
    num = int(input(f"Enter your {i} favourite number:"))
    num_list.append(num)

print(f"\nHello , {user_name} ! Let's explore your favourite numbers:")

for item in num_list:
    if item % 2 == 0:
        print(f"The number {item} is even")
    else:
        print(f"The number {item} is odd")

for item in num_list:
    print(f"The number {item} and its square: ({item}, {item**2})")

sum_of_num = sum(num_list)
print(f"Amazing! The sum of your favourite numbers is {sum_of_num}")

is_prime = True
if sum_of_num <= 1:
    is_prime = False
else:
    for x in range(2, sum_of_num):
        if sum_of_num % x == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

if is_prime:
    print(f"Great job! The number {sum_of_num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"Great job! The number {sum_of_num} is not a prime number.")
```

This version runs smoothly and checks for divisors of `sum_of_num` more efficiently.
